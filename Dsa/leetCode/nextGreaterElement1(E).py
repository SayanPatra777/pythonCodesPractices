'''
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

ðŸ§© Problem Recap (In Your Words)
You're given:
nums1 â€” a subset of nums2
For each element in nums1, find the next greater element in nums2.
If there's no greater element to its right â€” return -1
ðŸ’¡ Core Insight
Instead of looping through nums2 again and again for each nums1[i], we can preprocess nums2 once to record the next greater number for every element
